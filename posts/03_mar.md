## Introduction

<p>It was after monday's lunch where it dawn on me that there could be some data surrounding the Omega x Swatch collab Speedmaster Moonwatch.</p>

Just over the previous weekend, this watch collab was **[released](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/watch-world-hype-surges-as-swatch-omega-collaboration-hits-stores-192830402.html)** by Swatch where long lines were queued as early as 6am outside their outlets in MBS and Orchard. This was an non-exclusive watch release and they are not of a limited series.
Nonetheless, it still drew a huge crowd where everyone was trying to purchase them.

## Time Senstivity

There was already a couple of posts I've seen on LinkedIn where people from the marketing space were giving their 2 cents on this event.
In order to ride on the hype and join the conversation where this crazed behaviors were being discussed, I knew I didnt have much time should I aim to publish something around this.<br>

<p></p>

This project basically became a race against time.
Within the next 12 hours, I published this project on a LinkedIn post on what I managed to uncover.

## Formats

During this project, I was able to make use of Tableau's functionality to ensure the viz could be seen clearly across varied device sizes as some may be viewing it from their mobile devices.
This was something I didn't address when I published some of my earlier works.

## Closing

I really enjoyed the experience of producing this piece of work within a short period of time.
Perhaps this is my own attempt to experience what it is like to participate in data journalism.

<p></p>
This also taught and remindered me to be more 'sensitive' to such happenings as there could potentially be a data angle around it to be told.

## Here is the Published Work!

Some of the elements are interactive, so do checkout the viz **[here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrei7065/viz/Planet-Book/Dashboard1)**.

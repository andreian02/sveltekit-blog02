## Introduction

<p>It was a Monday after lunch where it dawn on me that there could be some data surrounding the Omega x Swatch collab Speedmaster Moonwatch to be explored.</p>

There were 11 different designs and they were scheduled to be release over the weekend. This was an non-exclusive watch release and were not of a limited series.
Nonetheless long lines were queued as early as 6am outside the Swatch outlets in MBS and in Orchard where everyone was trying to purchase them from the store.<br>

See news article **[here](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/watch-world-hype-surges-as-swatch-omega-collaboration-hits-stores-192830402.html)**.

## Time Senstivity

To partake on the hype and join the conversation where the crazed behavior over the watches are being discussed, I knew this is time senstive piece of work and I should aim to publish this as quickly as I can.
This was literally a race against time and within the next 12 hours, I published a data viz on a LinkedIn post of the Omega x Swatch Collab which was built using Tableau.

## Formats

During this project, I was able to make use of tableau's functionality to create a dyanmic viewport that changes when someone is viewing the viz on their mobile devices.

## Closing

I really enjoyed the experience of trying to produce this piece of work within a short period of time.
Perhaps this is my own attempt to experience what it is like to participate in data journalism.
It also taught me and also remindered me to more observant of things that are happening around us and to always push to see if there is data story around it and what could be told.

## Here is my Work!

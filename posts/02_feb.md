## Introduction

<p>I was reading Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life at the beginning of this year. After a couple of chapters, I decided to pen down specific goals for this year.</p>

<p>I believe it was also a quote similar to this that emphasis the need to try focus and be good at one thing, one key objective. 
</p>

<p></p>

<span>Orient yourself properly. Then–and only then–concentrate on the day. Set your sights at the Good, the Beautiful, and the True, and then focus pointedly and carefully on the concerns of each moment. Aim continually at Heaven while you work diligently on Earth. Attend fully to the future, in that manner, while attending fully to the present. Then you have the best chance of perfecting both. -Jordan Peterson</span>

## Inspiration

Ever since I chanced upon this **[article](https://pudding.cool/2021/10/judge-my-music/)** from a media publication called the pudding, I always try wanted to try and shape my role in my organisation towards their mission statement.

**_It is to explain ideas debated in culture with visual essays._**

Working in TBWA, understanding culture is a key differentiating factor in our business, I always wanted to contribute back to the business by using data to explain ideas or to think of ways what role data could play within this space. Hence the pudding's direction was exactly where I wanted to explore and grow towards.

## Building Blocks of Data Essays

Looking at the interactiveness of how data is being used to "story tell" in each of the pudding's articles, I knew getting into web development, learning about d3.js was the next step to take. Although I have attempted in data viz / story tell articles with Tableau, getting into web dev and couple that with d3.js would be a set of additional skill that I wish to develop next.

## Data Goals for 2022

Hence, the data goals for this year would be;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Hands on in Web Dev

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Using D3.js

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Apply web dev with D3.js on a Data Project

I am keeping my fingers crossed!

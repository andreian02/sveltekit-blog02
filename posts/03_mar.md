## Introduction

<p>It was a Monday after lunch where it dawn on me that there could be some data surrounding the Omega x Swatch collab Speedmaster Moonwatch to be explored.
I paniced because this could be a potential opporuntity not to be missed to produce a data piece around this phenomenon.</p>

There were 11 different designs and they were scheduled to be release over the weekend. This was an non-exclusive watch release and were not of a limited series.
However long lines were queued as early as 6am outside the Swatch outlets in MBS and in Orchard where everyone was trying to purchase one.<br>

## Time Senstivity

To partake on the hype and join the conversation where the crazed behavior over the watches are being discussed, I knew this would be a time senstive piece and I should aim to publish this as quickly as I can. In my mind, I have already narrow down a few go to area to get data on this phenomenon and this was literally a race against time.
Within the next 12 hours, I published a data viz post of the Omega x Swatch Collab which was built using Tableau.

## Formats

During this project, I was able to make use of tableau's functionality to create a dyanmic viewport that changes when someone is viewing the viz on their mobile devices.

## Closing

I really enjoyed the experience of trying to produce this piece of work within a short period of time.
It also taught me to think of things that are happening around us and to always push to see if there is data story around it and what could be told.
